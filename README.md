Glass Dance
===========

An app for Google Glass that teaches you how to dance - or at least show dance steps for particular dance. I have added English Waltz, and a mock up of a Vienna Waltz to show how choice screen is working.

To add new dance just add a method for it in InitDance, with format (leftFeetX, leftFeetY, rightFeetX, rightFeetY, timeInMiliseconds), also in DanceView class you can change how much earlier moves should be shown (good for beginners).

#####Below few screens to show how it looks
Dance selection screen, you can scroll right/left and tap is select.

And this is how dance steps screen look like, it isn't beautiful as I focused on clearness, and to make it easy to read even when dancing.
